# Vojtux manual test plan

This file contains test cases which should verify that Vojtux distribution live image is behaving as expected.
Currently, I do not have any automation around it, that's why I am writing here exact steps how to manually test some Vojtux features.

## IMPORTANT: a note about Orca behavior for TC >= 2

Please note that Orca is configured to announce all key presses including CTRL, ALT and SHIFT key by default.
I don't plan to test this behavior because I think most people just turn it off.
However, I don't want to turn it off in Vojtux unless there is a strong demand for this, I prefer to keep upstream configuration where possible.

Please ignore these orca announcements when testing or disable this behavior as follows:

1. Open Orca preferences by pressing Orca+Spacebar (Orca key is by default set to Insert)

2. Switch to the "Echo" tab

3. Disable announcements of keys which annoy you, probably "Modifier keys" and possibly "Action keys"
